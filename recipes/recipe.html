        <li>Add more water if needed.I used little less than 1 cup.If the batter is too thick then the chilla will not cook properly and may cause stomach upset</li>
        <li>Heat a tawa or griddle.If not using non stick pan, then grease it well with with few drops of oil.When it is hot enough,pour one ladle full of batter</li>
        <li>Spread it as thin as possible</li>
        <li>Regulate the flame to medium and drizzle 1/2 to 3/4 tsp of oil or ghee</li>
        <li>When the edge start leaving the pan flip the batter and repeate the same process</li>
        <li>When you see brown spots on both sides put chilla in another plate</li>
